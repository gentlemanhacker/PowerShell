Changes:
  Added code to check what is inside stream when you find one

Search across folder and subfolders for alternate data streams
#>
Get-ChildItem -Path 'C:\Users\' -recurse | ForEach { Get-Item $_.FullName -stream * } | Where stream -ne ':$DATA'

#Once you find the stream,  enter the location and stream name
#Get-Content 'C:\Users\location\document.ext' -stream streamname
#Future item: just code it to do this for you and export to file.
