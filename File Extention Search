Changes:
  Added how to find zip/rar files if extention is changed (hex strings identify file type)

Search across folder and subfolders for a file extention
#>

#Recursivley Search for zip files, get count
(Get-ChildItem -Path 'C:\Users\' -Filter *.zip -Recurse -File -Name).count
#Recursivley Search for rar files, get count
(Get-ChildItem -Path 'C:\Users\' -Filter *.rar -Recurse -File -Name).count

#The following can also look for rar and zip files that don't have the proper extentions
((Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Force -Include *.txt -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).FullName | ForEach-Object { Format-Hex -Path $_} | Select-String "50 4B", "52 61").count
